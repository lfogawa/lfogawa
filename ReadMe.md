# üí´ About Me:
Hello, my name is Lu√≠s, I'm 27 years old and live in S√£o Paulo, SP, Brazil.<br><br>Currently, I am in a career transition, studying and practicing HTML, CSS, and Javascript to secure my first remote job as a Full Stack Developer Jr. I am a creative and curious person, which makes my learning process fast and my results unique. I value a work environment where people can be themselves and where diversity and inclusion are a priority. My strengths, as recognized by leaders and colleagues, are adaptability, analytical thinking, taking ownership, and delivering quality work with agility. Due to this dedication, I consider it important to maintain a balance between my personal and professional life. I have good soft skills development overall, thanks to therapy with a psychologist and years of working under constant changes, such as changes in the company group, leadership, and teams, inherent to the market.<br><br>At Saraiva Educa√ß√£o, I work in the management of educational content production and maintenance of products, managing service providers and teachers. Using the scrumban agile methodology and the MoSCoW method, we guarantee regular deliveries and a respectful and pleasant work environment. We take the quality of the Saraiva label seriously, demanding the expected quality in all activities performed, while always keeping in mind the MVP. The dynamic and continuous relationship with other areas, promoting constant and accurate changes with the aim of providing an excellent user experience, is a living characteristic within the company. Additionally, I have gained various learning experiences by working closely with a century-old legal editorial, which provides the main doctrinal and legislative works at a national level. My history of working on products such as Saraiva Aprova, Campus Lab, ENADE Simulations, Saraiva Learning Solution (SSA), and Online Disciplines by Saraiva Educa√ß√£o (DONS) is a source of personal and professional pride.
